### The Prologue.
Skinner, from his antic explications,
Superintendent Chalmers’ heart doth grieve.
When he brunts such formless meditations,
Certain, then, a mischief marks this eve.
### Actus Primus. Scoena prima.
[Enter Skinner the Principal and Chalmers the Superintendent.]
Chalmers: Hark, O Seymour, I am come, and this
Despite your poor-professed guidance.
**Skinner:** A! 
Greetings, Chalmers, Superintendent. Sit,
I pray, and hope with eagerness you burn 
For such a noon repast that in your thoughts
Shall live eternal as Endymion.
**Chalmers:** Verily. 
*[Skinner discovereth the kitchen.]*
**Skinner:** Egads! My roast is burnt 
And black! A woeful feast that leaveth tongues
So hot and wounded as this meat should make.
But lo! I see without this clear, smooth pane
That Krusty’s Piehouse claims my neighbour plot.
Peradventure I will thither fly
Then hitherward return, and cite the dish,
There cheapened with haste, as my concoct.
Ha! Schemes as this, delightful as those shewn
Of Mephistophilis in Marlowe’s play,
Become thee well, good Seymour.
*[He would exit from the window. Chalmers observeth him, whilst Dancers enter and perform a Bergamask. Exeunt dancers.]*
**Chalmers:** Seymour!
**Skinner:** Chalmers!
I but stretch my legs upon the casement.
In Siena do they counsel this
To strengthen humours and extend one’s life. 
Meet me, pray, sir! I entreat you.
**Chalmers:** Nay. 
Stranger things than this distrain my mind,
Which I perceive before me in this room:
Why smoke so black as from the mouth of Hell
Where weeping souls in anguish’d pain converge,
Now from your cook-pot reaches unto Heaven.
**Skinner:** Nay. ‘Tis no smoke you spy, but steam.
From the steamed lamb which I prepare.
The tender flesh, so succulent and fine,
Doth make me crave and yearn for us to dine.
*[Exit Skinner unseen.]*
### Actus Primus. Scoena Secunda.
*[Chalmers expectant to dine. Enter Skinner, bearing a platter of pies.]*
**Skinner:** Prepare your mouth, good sir, in readiness
For pies of pork, of whose delicious scent
The tongue to ardent appetite is stirr’d.
**Chalmers:** Why, methinks thou spoke a while agone
That we should dine on steamed lamb.
**Skinner:** Oh, no!
I fear you, sir, mistook my syllable.
My labor was in cooking steamed hams.
That thereby, I style pies of pork.
**Chalmers:** Claimest thou pork pies are steamed hams?
**Skinner:** Yes. It is a term of local cant. 
**Chalmers:** Local to what place?
**Skinner:** Up north, in York.
**Chalmers:** How can this be so? For I was born
Within those ancient, moss-speck’d city walls,
That above the people rise immortal,
Marking of that region’s honour’d past,
Where emperors have sought to spend their days,
Eschewing all the luxury of Rome,
And mighty royals capp’d their golden crowns
Upon their noble heads whilst they did frame
That land as fit for England’s capital;
And there I dwelt throughout my younger span,
And never did I hear of steamed hams.
**Skinner:** O! This is never said within the walls,
But from the yeomen who without reside.
**Chalmers:** So it has to be, if it be so.
But I perceive the seasoning of these
To be alike to that which Krusty makes
At his own piehouse.
**Skinner:** Such can never be,
For, sir, this make of pie is anciently
Recorded in my family’s household books
As a receipt for Skinner’s own pork pie.
**Chalmers:** Yet named steamed hams?
**Skinner:** Ay that it is.
**Chalmers:** And thou declar’st them steamed hams, although,
Upon the pallid wheat and butter paste
It is attested of the toasted marks
That steamed hams as these are baker’s work?
**Skinner:** Alas! I see a mighty smudge of black
Which danceth from my kitchen through the door,
Alike Saloma, shedding sooty veils.
I beg your pardon, sir, I shall return.
**Chalmers:** With my leave, do so.
*[Skinner withdraws and returns.]*
**Skinner: **Alackaday!
The kitchen is engulf’d in roaring flame,
For neglected me the roast to wrench,
Though all ablaze, from out mine oven’s void;
’Tis now risen to a fearsome glow,
But I shall overskip the conflagration
Biding while till Chalmers doth away,
Lest such errors make me look a fool.
O, sir! Such a merry time was had!
We reveled in mirth and jollity,
But ay, alas, I wearily am spent.
**Chalmers:** Indeed, the hour is late. I should away.
But, look! O Lord! What happens in that room?
**Skinner:** It is nothing but a blazing star.
**Chalmers:** Fie, fie! A blazing star? Upon the Earth,
Upon your hearth, estated well beneath the firmament?
**Skinner:** Indeed.
**Chalmers:** Pray, let me witness.
**Skinner: **I will not,
For it should ill become a gentleman
If he be kitchened of lesser-than. 
*[Exeunt.]*
### Actus Primus. Scoena Tertia.
*[Enter Chalmers and Skinner. Agnes above.]*
**Skinner:** Farewell to you, and may you have good e’en.
**Chalmers: **Adieu then, Seymour, till we meet again.
**Agnes: **Seymour! Hark! The house is all aflame!
**Skinner:** Nay, mother dear. ’Tis but a blazing star.
**Chalmers:** Certes, good Seymour, though thou art distinct
In singularity, declare I shall,
Thine hams are steamed passing past all fault.
**Agnes:** Help! O someone bring this blaze to halt!
*[Exit Chalmers. Exeunt Skinner and Agnes.]*
### FINIS.
